                <h2>EYWA</h2>
                <p>EYWA is a system that allows various ecosystems of blockchains to interact with each other. 
                    We provide a possibility for users to quickly and cheaply move their assets among different networks, 
                    and for developers to effectively implement cross-chain logic for their decentralized applications. 
                    The core architectural element of the EYWA ecosystem is the EYWA Cross-chain Data Protocol, which is a transport layer among blockchains. 
                    All EYWA products for the DeFi users are based on this protocol.</p>

                <h2>Mint NFT</h2>
                <p>Our collection consists of 4 mythical characters with different kinds of modifications. Each NFT is randomly created from different layers, which ultimately forms a single character image: body, head, legs, 
                    background and a layer with accumulated points. This combination of layers will form the final value of each NFT.</p>
                <p>The NFT Characters are generated from a combination of layers, starting from the background and body, to clothes, hair and the number of locked tokens. 
                    Uniqueness is determined depending on the content of the token: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Legendary.</p>

                <h2>Vesting Rules</h2>
                <p>A vesting period is a time interval during which tokens of the early investors, advisors, team members, alpha-testers, early validators are unlocked according to a priorly approved schedule. 
                    The tokens unlock logic is programmed inside of smart contracts and cannot be changed.</p>
                <p>A vesting mechanism allows to reduce pressure on a token market price, 
                    a probability of speculation and protects interests of token holders, and positively affects the long-term development of the project.</p>
